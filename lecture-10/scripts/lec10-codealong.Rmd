```{r}

setwd("/Users/jeff/Documents/Github/data-science/lecture-10/data")
complaints <- readRDS("cfpb_complaints.rds")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
